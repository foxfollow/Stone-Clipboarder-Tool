# Privacy Policy

`Heorhii Savoiskyi` developed the `Stone Clipboarder` app as a free application. This Service is offered by `Heorhii Savoiskyi` at no cost and is meant for use as is. This document serves to inform users about my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data for those choosing to use my Service.

The `Stone Clipboarder` app does not collect or store any personal data from its users. There are no account systems, no user authentication, and no marketing data collection. The app does not require you to provide any personal information for it to function.

## Information Collection and Use
The `Stone Clipboarder` app does not collect personal information. The app operates entirely on your local device and stores clipboard history data locally using SwiftData. All clipboard content remains on your device and is never transmitted to external servers or third parties.

The app monitors your clipboard to automatically save copied text for local storage and retrieval. This monitoring happens entirely on your device, and no clipboard data is sent anywhere outside your Mac.

## Third-Party Services
The app uses the Sparkle framework (https://sparkle-project.org) for automatic software updates. Sparkle is an open-source framework that enables the app to check for and install updates automatically.

### Sparkle Framework Data Collection
Sparkle may collect the following system information when checking for updates (only if explicitly enabled by us as developers):
- macOS version
- CPU type and specifications
- Mac model information
- Application name and version
- User's preferred language

This system profiling information is sent anonymously and only once per week to help us understand what platforms to support. We do not currently have system profiling enabled, but if we enable it in the future, this policy will be updated to reflect that change.

## Log Data
If an error occurs while using the Service, Apple may collect data and information (through their services) known as Log Data. This Log Data may include details like your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address, device name, operating system version, app configuration, the time and date of your Service use, and other relevant statistics. **This data is collected and managed by Apple, not by `Heorhii Savoiskyi`.** You can review Apple's privacy policy for more information.

## Local Data Storage
The `Stone Clipboarder` app stores clipboard history locally on your device using SwiftData. This includes:
- Text content you copy to your clipboard
- Timestamps of when items were copied
- User preferences and settings

All this data remains on your device and is never shared with external parties. You can delete this data at any time through the app's interface or by uninstalling the app.

## Cookies
The `Stone Clipboarder` app does not use cookies. The app operates as a native macOS application and does not include web-based components that would utilize cookies.

## Service Providers
The `Stone Clipboarder` app currently employs the following third-party service:

**Sparkle Framework** - Used for automatic software updates. Sparkle is an open-source framework that checks our servers for new app versions and facilitates secure updates.

If additional third-party companies are employed in the future, they may be used for the following reasons:
- To facilitate our Service;
- To deliver the Service on our behalf;
- To perform Service-related tasks;
- To assist in analyzing how our Service is used.

If third-party services are added, they will only have access to your information as needed to perform specific tasks on our behalf and will be obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

## Security
While the `Stone Clipboarder` app stores data locally on your device, we value your trust and are committed to protecting your clipboard data. The app uses macOS's built-in security features and SwiftData's secure storage mechanisms. However, no method of electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of data stored on your device.

## Links to Other Sites
The `Stone Clipboarder` app may contain links to third-party websites. If you click on a link to another site, you will be redirected there. Note that these external sites are not managed by `Heorhii Savoiskyi`, and I strongly recommend reviewing their privacy policies. I have no control over and take no responsibility for the content, privacy practices, or policies of third-party sites or services.

## Children's Privacy
These Services are not aimed at anyone under the age of 13 years. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal data, I will immediately delete it. If you are a parent or guardian and become aware that your child has submitted personal information, please contact me so I can take the appropriate action.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time, and you are advised to review this page regularly for any updates. I will notify you of any changes by posting the updated Privacy Policy here.

This policy is effective as of 2025-08-08.

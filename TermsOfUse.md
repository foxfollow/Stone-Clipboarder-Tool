# Terms of Use

## Main
By downloading or using the `Stone Clipboarder` app, you automatically agree to these terms, so we strongly encourage you to read them carefully before proceeding. Although the source code is open, I kindly request that you do not copy, modify, or redistribute the app without acknowledging me as the author and notifying me. Additionally, please do not use the names, trademarks, or images created by me without permission. All intellectual property rights, including trademarks, copyrights, and database rights, remain the sole property of `Heorhii Savoiskyi`.

`Heorhii Savoiskyi` is dedicated to making the app as functional and effective as possible. As part of this commitment, we reserve the right to modify the app or impose charges for its services, at any time and for any reason. Rest assured, we will always clearly communicate any fees before they apply to you.

**The `Stone Clipboarder` app does not collect, store, or process any personal data externally.** There are no account systems, no user authentication, and no marketing data collection. The app does not require you to provide any personal information to function. All clipboard data is stored locally on your device using SwiftData and never transmitted to external servers.

Keeping your Mac and access to the app secure is your responsibility. We strongly recommend keeping your macOS system updated with the latest security patches to ensure the `Stone Clipboarder` app functions properly and securely.

## Third-Party Services
The app uses the Sparkle framework (https://sparkle-project.org) for automatic software updates. Sparkle is an open-source framework distributed under the MIT license that enables secure automatic updates.

### Sparkle Framework
By using the app, you consent to the app checking for updates through the Sparkle framework. Sparkle may optionally collect anonymous system information (such as macOS version, hardware specifications, and app version) to help developers understand platform usage.

If we decide to integrate additional third-party services in the future, any such updates will be clearly communicated.

Please note, there are certain limitations to our responsibility. The app is designed to work on macOS 15.0+ and requires clipboard access permissions to function properly. The app also requires internet connectivity to check for automatic updates through the Sparkle framework. `Heorhii Savoiskyi` is not responsible for the app's reduced functionality if you deny necessary system permissions, lack internet connectivity for updates, or if your system does not meet the minimum requirements.

The `Stone Clipboarder` app monitors your clipboard to automatically save copied text for local storage and retrieval. By using the app, you consent to this clipboard monitoring functionality, understanding that all data remains on your local device.

`Heorhii Savoiskyi` does not accept liability for any direct or indirect loss that may result from relying on the app's functions, including but not limited to loss of clipboard data due to system issues, app crashes, user error, or issues related to the automatic update process.

At times, updates to the app may be necessary. The app currently supports macOS 15.0+, and system requirements may evolve. If you wish to continue using the app, you'll need to install these updates when available. `Heorhii Savoiskyi` does not guarantee that the app will remain compatible with your device's software, and you agree to install all updates provided. We may also discontinue the app at any time, and upon termination, all rights granted to you will be revoked, and you must uninstall the app from your device.

## Data Responsibility
While the app stores clipboard history locally on your device, you are responsible for:
- Managing sensitive information that may be copied to your clipboard
- Regularly reviewing and deleting clipboard items containing sensitive data
- Understanding that clipboard monitoring captures all text copied while the app is running
- Securing your device to prevent unauthorized access to stored clipboard history

## Changes to the Terms of Use
We may periodically update these Terms of Use, and you are encouraged to check this page regularly. Any changes will be posted here, and we will notify you about significant updates.

These terms are effective from 2025-08-08.
